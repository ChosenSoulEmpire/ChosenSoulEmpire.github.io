                <p>
                    Chosen Soul Empire offers practical tools, motivational 
                    encouragement, therapeutic art sessions, and faith-based 
                    teaching to propel your personal growth and ignite your 
                    journey to emotional healing. Do you feel like there are 
                    missing elements in your healing process? Despite attending 
                    retreats, reading numerous books, and seeking therapy, you 
                    may still feel like you lack practical tools or struggle to 
                    understand how to forgive from the heart and move forward. 
                    Perhaps unforgiveness is deeply rooted in your heart, 
                    leading to repeated cycles of emotional setbacks. We are 
                    dedicated to guiding you through a transformative journey of
                     self-discovery and emotional healing, utilizing various 
                     artistic disciplines such as music, painting, drawing, 
                     mindfulness, sculpting, and writing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our aim is to heal one soul at a time through the 
                    transformative power of forgiveness, prayer, art, and 
                    creativity. We encourage you to unravel the principles of 
                    forgiveness through introspection, while tending to your 
                    mental health and rekindling your relationship with God. We 
                    firmly believe in one God in three persons the Father, the 
                    Son, and the Holy Spirit. Our conviction lies in Jesus as 
                    the son of God, who sacrificed himself for our sins.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are cordially invited to participate in our emotional 
                    healing paint party wellness workshops, conferences, or 
                    retreats. Our events are inclusive to all, regardless of 
                    your beliefs. We warmly welcome you to embark on this 
                    profound, loving, and transformative journey to address your
                    pain and unforgiveness in a safe, creative, and spiritually 
                    uplifting environment.

                <h2 id="title">Biblical Healing Formula</h2>
                <h4>Matthew 13:15</h4>
                <p>
                    For the hearts of these people are hardened, and their ears 
                    cannot hear, and they have closed their eyes so their eyes 
                    cannot see, and their ears cannot hear, and their hearts 
                    cannot understand, and they cannot turn to me and let me 
                    heal them.
                </p>
                <h4>Psalms 36:2-3</h4>
                <p>
                    In their own eyes they flatter themselves too much to detect
                    or hate their sin. The words of their mouths are wicked and 
                    deceitful; they fail to act wisely or do good.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Bible is clear about why our healing might be delayed. 
                    We hinder our healing by refusing to see, hear, and 
                    understand the truth, and by not turning to God for healing.
                    Instead, we might believe that we can handle things on our 
                    own, and we may replace the truth with lies. These lies may 
                    serve as a crutch for us to get through the day or to cling 
                    to anger and unforgiveness. We use these lies as a shield to
                    protect ourselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To begin the healing process, <b>we need to allow ourselves 
                    to be vulnerable with God.</b> Our hearts must be open to 
                    hear, see, receive, and learn. Next, we need to <b>listen 
                    clearly</b> to what God is saying about our situation, which
                    can be found in His Word and through our spiritual 
                    understanding. We also need to <b>see the truth clearly</b> 
                    in our situation. We should perceive the reality of the 
                    circumstance, our identity in Christ, and who God is, all 
                    from a godly perspective rather than a perspective clouded 
                    by brokenness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, we need to <b>understand in our hearts</b> what
                    we hear from God and what we see in our situation, and then 
                    accept it. This means not relying on our own understanding 
                    or creating our own version of events. Understanding means 
                    hearing God, accepting it, and trusting Him. Lastly, we must
                    <b>turn to God and trust that His answer is sufficient.</b>
                    We must allow Him to lead us and heal us, with His word 
                    guiding our actions for change, growth, and healing.
